# MTGPimp
Find out all the different version and languages of a single card, or an entire decklist! Easier than parsing archaic forum posts to figure out if there's a Korean black bordered brainstorm with Chris Rush art, and then doing it over and over for all 75 cards in your list. 

To use the site, go to mtgpimp.info (or whatever combination of url you'd like!)

As the text shows, enter your cards, one card per line.
